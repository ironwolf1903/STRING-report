# Comparative Analysis of STRING & HuRI Databases  
**Author:** Demir Kurt (TUM / LMU)  

## Summary  
This project presents a comparative report analysing the features, strengths and limitations of two major protein–protein interaction (PPI) databases: STRING and HuRI. The report discusses data sources, interaction confidence metrics, network coverage, functional annotation, and suitability for downstream analyses (e.g., interactome mapping). The accompanying presentation summarises key findings and visualises the comparative results.

## Repository Structure  
| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Demir Kurt PBL Report.pdf** | The full written report of the comparative analysis (PBL = Problem-based Learning). |
| **Interactome Mapping.pdf** | The presentation slides summarising the main results and visuals of the project. |

## How to Use  
1. Open **Demir Kurt PBL Report.pdf** to read the detailed analysis, methods, and conclusions.  
2. Use **Interactome Mapping.pdf** for a high-level overview and visual summary (suitable for presentation/lecture).  
3. No code or data files are included in this repository — the focus is solely on the report and its presentation.

## Notes  
- The report draws on publicly available PPI databases and relevant literature; references are included in the document.  
- All figures and tables are embedded in the report and presentation for clarity.  
- If you would like to replicate any analyses or visualisations, please consult the Methods section of the report for suggested workflow references.
